## Dashboard:
Total Revenue (11M)
Question:
What is the overall revenue generated from the online retail store? How does this compare to previous periods?
How much of this revenue is attributed to repeat customers versus new customers?
Conclusion:
The online retail business has generated a total revenue of 11 million. This can be considered a strong indicator of the store's sales performance. If tracked month-over-month, it can be used to measure revenue growth. The number would suggest a healthy business if it has been growing steadily, especially if a significant portion comes from repeat customers.

Total Quantity Sold (6M)
Question:
How many total products have been sold through the store?
What is the relationship between the number of items sold and total revenue?
Conclusion:
A total of 6 million items have been sold, suggesting strong customer demand. The ratio between total revenue (11M) and total quantity sold (6M) can give an idea of the average price per item. This also hints at how pricing might be affecting overall sales.

Active Customers (1M)
Question:
How many unique customers made purchases within a specific period?
How does the number of active customers correlate with repeat purchases and revenue generation?
Conclusion:
The store has engaged 1 million active customers, which indicates a wide customer base. This metric is crucial for understanding customer acquisition efforts. Retaining a portion of these active customers as repeat buyers could be a key strategy for future revenue growth.

Products List
Question:
What are the top products sold by the store, and what quantities have been sold for each?
Are there any specific products driving a significant portion of revenue?
Conclusion:
The list shows the top products, with “4 PURPLE FLOCK DINNER” appearing multiple times. This suggests that the product is popular and likely driving a significant portion of sales. This insight can inform future stock planning and marketing efforts to boost sales of high-demand items.

Monthly Trend (Line Chart)
Question:
How has sales performance fluctuated month over month? Are there any seasonal trends or significant peaks in sales?
What factors contributed to the highest sales in December (15.33%)?
Conclusion:
Sales have shown variability over the year, with a significant peak in December (15.33%). This suggests a potential holiday shopping season boost. Other months, such as January and March, also show lower sales. Tracking sales trends helps understand when promotional efforts and stock levels should be increased.

These customers are likely responsible for a large portion of revenue, suggesting a focus on customer retention strategies could be beneficial. Personalized offers could encourage further purchases from these top buyers.

Country Filter:
Question:
How can filtering by country help analyze the data? What insights can be gained by viewing specific countries' sales and customer data?

By applying the country filter, the store can narrow down sales performance, customer activity, and product preferences by region. This allows for better-targeted marketing campaigns and logistics planning.

Month Filter:
Question:
How does sales performance differ across months? What trends are visible when filtering for specific months?

Question:
Where are customers located around the world? Which geographic regions show high sales density?
Are there any untapped regions that could present new sales opportunities?
